            <h1>About the Author</h1>
            <p> <span style={{fontSize:'30px' }}><b>D</b></span>r. Tee-Tee is an early career Pediatrician (still in residency) who has a love for children of all ages, different cultures, and writing stories that make people laugh, think, and learn how to be good to themselves and to others. <br />
            A proud Hoosier, she hails from Indianapolis, Indiana but she has loved living in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and now Oklahoma. Her time as an AmeriCorps volunteer in 2013-2014 is what jumpstarted her desire to use her voice, time, and talents to give back to the community and help be a bridge between healthcare field and underserved populations. 
            <br />
            She is a daughter, sister, (future) wife, and, like Ife, a proud Nigerian-American. An avid reader, Dr. Tee-Tee's guilty pleasure/secret talent is reading children books and biography books while simultaneously navigating a shopping cart in grocery stores without hitting anybody or anything.
